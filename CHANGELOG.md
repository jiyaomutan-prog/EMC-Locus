# Changelog

All notable changes to EMC Locus are recorded here.

The project follows Semantic Versioning once public releases begin. During the
foundation phase, `0.x.y` versions may still evolve quickly, but every committed
change should remain traceable through Git history, session logs, and this file.

### Added

- Contract-review stage gate before test planning.
- Authorized contract-review deviation event for incomplete checklists.
- Rust tests for complete checklist, incomplete checklist, authorized deviation,
  project mismatch, and invalid-stage behavior.
- Public BAT-EMC/Nexio feature baseline for product positioning.
- Offline-first architecture direction with split, synchronizable repositories.
